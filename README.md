# Text-to-Speech Conversion Using gTTS

This project demonstrates how to use the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library in Python to convert text from a file into speech and save it as an audio file. The generated audio can then be played directly.

## Features

- Reads text from a file (`abc.txt`).
- Converts the text into speech using the `gTTS` library.
- Saves the output as an MP3 file (`voice.mp3`).
- Plays the generated MP3 file automatically.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need the following:

1. Python installed on your system.
2. The `gTTS` library.

## Installation
 Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
